# Introduction to programming 

## Programming Language
- Program = recipe that computer follow
- Low level language = more likely computer language
- High level language = more likely human language

## High Level code in C++
It is called SOURCE CODE
It consists of .cpp, .h files (others can be used too)

## Low level code in C++
It is called OBJECT CODE (or binary code)
It consists of .obj files (windows) or .o files (linux)

## Compiler 
It translates from high level to low level
(source code to object code)

## Linker
It links together our compiled code with libraries and creates a executable program.

## Interpreted Languages
Interpreted languages, such as Python or Javascript, executes compilation in run time (= execution time). 

Considering that in compiled languages the executable is already in computer language and interpreted languages compiles source code in run time, it is normal that interpreted languages are slower than compiled languages.

## Testing and Debbugging 
It consists of finding and fix program errors.

## IDE = Integrated Development Environment
It can consists of:
    - editor
    - compiler
    - linker
    - debugger
    - keep everything in sync

## Examples of IDEs for C++:
- CodeLite (free, good, light and cross plataform)
- Visual Studio Code (open source microsoft IDE, cross plataform)
- Code::Blocks (Mac version is buggy)
- NetBeans (Oracle IDE)
- Eclipse (cross plataform but heavy)
- CLion (not free)
- Dev-C++ (windows only)
- KDevelop (non mac)
- Xcode (Mac IDE)
- Visual Studio (other microsoft IDE, but not free)
