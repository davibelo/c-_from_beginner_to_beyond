# C++ Keywords
This is a list of reserved keywords in C++. Since they are used by the language, these keywords are not available for re-definition or overloading.

C++ has about 90 keywords... java about 50, python 33...

# C++ Preprocessor directives
Preprocessor directives are lines included in the code of programs preceded by a hash sign (#). These lines are not program statements but directives for the preprocessor. The preprocessor examines the code before actual compilation of code begins and resolves all these directives before any code is actually generated by regular statements.

These preprocessor directives extend only across a single line of code. As soon as a newline character is found, the preprocessor directive is ends. No semicolon (;) is expected at the end of a preprocessor directive. The only way a preprocessor directive can extend through more than one line is by preceding the newline character at the end of the line by a backslash (\).

There are 4 main types of preprocessor directives:  

- Macros
- File Inclusion
- Conditional Compilation
- Other directives

Concept Example: 
Use preprocessor directives to test the Operational System that you are running the code and adding some libraries according to it

> Remember these directives are not cpp statements

## Macros
Macros are a piece of code in a program which is given some name. Whenever this name is encountered by the compiler the compiler replaces the name with the actual piece of code. The ‘#define’ directive is used to define a macro. Let us now understand the macro definition with the help of a program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
 
// macro definition
#define LIMIT 5
int main()
{
    for (int i = 0; i < LIMIT; i++) {
        std::cout << i << "\n";
    }
 
    return 0;
}
```

## Macros with arguments
We can also pass arguments to macros. Macros defined with arguments works similarly as functions. Let us understand this with a program: 

#include <iostream>

```cpp 
// macro with parameter
#define AREA(l, b) (l * b)
int main()
{
    int l1 = 10, l2 = 5, area;
 
    area = AREA(l1, l2);
 
    std::cout << "Area of rectangle is: " << area;
 
    return 0;
}
```

## File Inclusion
This type of preprocessor directive tells the compiler to include a file in the source code program. There are two types of files which can be included by the user in the program: 

Header File or Standard files: These files contains definition of pre-defined functions like printf(), scanf() etc. These files must be included for working with these functions. Different function are declared in different header files. For example standard I/O functions are in ‘iostream’ file whereas functions which perform string operations are in ‘string’ file. 

```cpp
#include< file_name >
```

## Conditional Compilation
Conditional Compilation directives are type of directives which helps to compile a specific portion of the program or to skip compilation of some specific part of the program based on some conditions. This can be done with the help of two preprocessing commands ‘ifdef‘ and ‘endif‘. 

```cpp
#ifdef macro_name
    statement1;
    statement2;
    statement3;
    .
    .
    .
    statementN;
#endif
```

# C++ Main Function
The main function is called at program startup after initialization of the non-local objects with static storage duration. It is the designated entry point to a program that is executed in hosted environment (that is, with an operating system)

All C++ programs must have a main function. If you try to compile a C++ program without a main function, the compiler raises an error. (Dynamic-link libraries and static libraries don't have a main function.) 

# C++ Comments
Comments can be used to explain C++ code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code. Comments can be singled-lined or multi-lined.
Single-line Comments

- Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).
- Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.

# C++ Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.

In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

- int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
- float, double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
- char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
- string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
- bool - stores values with two states: true or false

# C++ Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
